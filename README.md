## Description 
<p align="justify">This project leverages socio-economic, health, and COVID-19 data from U.S. counties to provide insights into the interdependencies between public health outcomes, demographics, and socio-economic factors. The dataset explores metrics like COVID-19 cases, health insurance coverage, income disparities, and other demographic indicators such as the elderly population, which offer a detailed view of vulnerabilities at the county level. Understanding these factors allows policymakers to prioritize resource allocation and health interventions where they are needed most, especially during pandemics or public health crises.</p>

## Business Problem 
<p align="justify">The COVID-19 pandemic exposed socio-economic and healthcare disparities across US states, with high senior populations, uninsured rates, and income disparities driving the risk of death. Insurance companies have the opportunities to improve health care access through expanding insurance, addressing drug-related deaths, and preparing for elderly care needs provides opportunities to reduce preventable deaths and strengthen public health systems. Prioritizing interventions in high-risk countries can improve outcomes and ensure better pandemic preparedness.</p>
